# X-MAS CTF 2020

This was the first CTF I ever took part in, and was a lot of fun.

It lasted a week, so my team and I had plenty of time to tackle different challenges, which was exiting because pretty much  everything that I saw was new.

We ended up finishing in the top #100, which we're super proud of. While we mostly focused on the misc category, we had a go at and made progress with a few others as well. The highlight was definitely being the first team to solve the WAT O_O challenge.

The first commit here only contains the code we used to solve Krampus' lair, a python3 jail placed at the end of a small text adventure. Code for other challenges were not written inside of my VM, so they will be included in a later commit. Krampus' lair was the challenge we spent most of our time on, and was by far the most euphoric flag we've obtained so far.
