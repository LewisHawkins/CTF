# CTF Templates

This is a folder containing templates for code that will be used frequently within challenges, so that they can be copy + pasted from here when needed.

Currently contains:
- server.py - a program for creating a socket to send and receive data from a given URL and port number, often used to automate challenges that require a connection with netcat (nc).

Will soon contain:
- classicRSA.py - a program that can quickly be edited to decrypt ciphertext that is encoding using RSA with a vulnerable prime number that can be found and factorised on factordb.
